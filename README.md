Homework for Module 22 - Big Data

## Summary

In this assignment, I used the Apache Spark and PySpark libraries to create temp views to query home sales data. This notebook is meant to be run in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). The PySpark needs to be updated to the current version, found [here](http://www.apache.org/dist/spark/) in order for the notebook to work.
